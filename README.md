# Foam-Shear-Mixer-Automation

**Title:** 
Foam Shear Mixer Automation

**Introduction:** 
Microcontroller code via CircuitPython to automate the foam shear mixer

**How to install:** 
Plug in microcontroller (Metro M4 Express) via microUSB cable. If the microcontroller is named "METROM4BOOT" in the file explorer, then download [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/metro_m4_express/), and drag the file onto the microcontroller name. The microcontroller should then become renamed as "CIRCUITPY". Download and drag the script onto the microcontroller, ensuring it is named "code.py". Overwrite the file on the microcontroller if neccessary.
